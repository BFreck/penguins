# Penguins
The penguins data was collected from 2007 to 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program. 
It is a dataset comprised of various measurements of the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap species. 

It has become a part of the data landscape as much as the Ames housing dataset or data from Titanic. 

While I do look forward to getting a big, shiny, and perhaps *original* project in here, it's been good to get back into the groove
with this exercise after a few months away.

There are two data sets, each with 344 observations. The data isn't perfect but it isn't overly difficult to cleanse and move forward with. 
It's definitely more of an exercise than a project. It showcases basic data manipulating and graphing using Python.
